# Practice task
TodoApp ✅


Any styling, even mui component is enough, otherwise use mui styled (without css) ✅


Extra points:
* Save the result to firebase or SQL db (create a simple BE++ for this)  ✅
* Deploy app in free deploy platform  ✅
* Make a pokemon page, with slider or listing from pokemon api (free api) ✅

upload 20 pokemon (ideally with upload more using the button) + make a card, another page. ✅

# Pokemons
Idk why Firebase hosting doesnt see links, i add button for it :)

# Render Time
Since the mui library is one of the most demanding and space-consuming graphics libraries for React, I tried to split the rendering pieces into different components as much as possible in order to get a better rendering picture.
