# Practice task
## TODO app with pages:
### 
Create a todo app,
on the `dashboard` page, create a single todo with an interface:
```ts
name: string
description: string
time: string (unix time stamp)
```
creation must be 3 inputs, 2 text + 1 dateTime  
write each task to redux, use reduxToolKit.  
Example of code in theme  
Any styling, even mui component is enough, otherwise use mui styled (without css)
Extra points:
* Save the result to firebase or SQL db (create a simple BE++ for this)  
* Deploy app in free deploy platform  
* Make a pokemon page, with slider or listing from pokemon api (free api)
upload 20 pokemon (ideally with upload more using the button) + make a card, another page.
